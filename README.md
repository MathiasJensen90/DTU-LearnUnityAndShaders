This project is meant to get you started learning Unity!
It's split in two parts:

2. Unity Shaders


## Unity Basics
In this section, you'll have three tasks!
1. You'll learn how to navigate around the editor, and some common terms (GameObjects, Prefabs, Materials).
2. You'll make your first script learning how to use C# to steer GameObjects.
